# My Look Once to Hear Demo 🎤

This folder contains all the demo scripts to test and use your Look Once to Hear system!

## 📁 Files in this folder:

### 🚀 **Quick Start Files:**

1. **`test_demo.py`** - Test that everything works
   ```bash
   python test_demo.py
   ```
   - Verifies your system is working
   - Uses existing test data
   - Shows expected performance

2. **`interactive_demo.py`** - Easy demo with your audio files
   ```bash
   python interactive_demo.py
   ```
   - Put your audio files in this folder
   - Guided step-by-step interface
   - Automatically finds your audio files

### 🔧 **Advanced Files:**

3. **`personal_demo.py`** - Full demo class for programming
   ```python
   from personal_demo import PersonalDemo
   demo = PersonalDemo()
   demo.enroll_speaker("target.wav")
   results = demo.separate_target_speaker("mixture.wav", "output.wav")
   ```

4. **`realtime_demo.py`** - Real-time processing example
   - Shows how to process audio chunks
   - Demonstrates streaming capability
   - Template for hardware deployment

## 🎯 **How to Use:**

### **Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended first)**
```bash
cd my_demo
python test_demo.py
```

### **Option 2: Your Own Audio Files**
1. Put your .wav audio files in the `demo_recordings` folder:
   - `target_speaker.wav` (3-5 seconds of clear speech)
   - `noisy_mixture.wav` (multiple speakers + background noise)

2. Run interactive demo:
   ```bash
   python interactive_demo.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts and listen to results!

## 📋 **Audio File Requirements:**

### **Enrollment Audio (Target Speaker):**
- ✅ 3-5 seconds of clear speech
- ✅ Minimal background noise
- ✅ Good audio quality
- ✅ Must be .wav format
- ✅ Put in `demo_recordings/` folder

### **Mixture Audio (Noisy Scene):**
- ✅ Contains your target speaker
- ✅ Mixed with other speakers/noise
- ✅ Can be longer (10+ seconds)
- ✅ More challenging = better demo!

## 🎵 **Example Workflow:**

```python
# 1. Load the system
from personal_demo import PersonalDemo
demo = PersonalDemo()

# 2. "Look Once" - Enroll target speaker
demo.enroll_speaker("demo_recordings/my_target_person.wav")

# 3. "To Hear" - Extract from noisy mixture
results = demo.separate_target_speaker("demo_recordings/party_noise.wav", "clean_output.wav")

# 4. Analyze results
demo.analyze_results(results)
```

## 💡 **Tips for Best Results:**

1. **Enrollment Audio:**
   - Record in quiet environment
   - Use good microphone
   - Clear, natural speech
   - Avoid music/effects

2. **Mixture Audio:**
   - Target speaker should be audible
   - Multiple speakers works better
   - Binaural/stereo preferred
   - Real-world scenarios

3. **Performance:**
   - Expect 5-15 dB improvement
   - Speaker similarity: 80-95%
   - Works with ANY speaker
   - No retraining needed

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **"Import Error"**
- Make sure you're in the `my_demo` folder
- Run: `cd my_demo` first

### **"File Not Found"**
- Put audio files in `my_demo` folder
- Check file extensions (.wav, .mp3, etc.)

### **"Poor Results"**
- Use clearer enrollment audio
- Ensure target speaker is in mixture
- Try different audio files

## 🎉 **What This System Can Do:**

- ✅ **Any Speaker**: Works with voices never heard before
- ✅ **Real-time**: Process audio in 8ms chunks
- ✅ **High Quality**: Research-grade speech enhancement
- ✅ **Spatial Audio**: Preserves binaural characteristics
- ✅ **Mobile Ready**: Optimized for deployment

## 📚 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test with provided data**: `python test_demo.py`
2. **Try your own audio**: `python interactive_demo.py` 
3. **Experiment with code**: Import `PersonalDemo` class
4. **Deploy on hardware**: Use `realtime_demo.py` as template
